"""Fail the build when the plugin depends on an Ashita vtable slot that differs between MinGW and MSVC.

GCC lays out virtual functions in declaration order. MSVC does too, except that every overload of a name is pulled
up next to its first declaration. A method that is not overloaded keeps its slot in both layouts unless an overload
group around it is split, so this emulates both layouts and compares slots for every interface method the sources
call. Overloaded and variadic methods are rejected outright, and IPluginBase (whose vtable the plugin builds) must
have neither.

A method that returns a struct by value is rejected too: MSVC member functions return it through a hidden pointer,
while MinGW expects a small one such as ImVec2 back in registers, so Ashita writes the result to a stray address.
